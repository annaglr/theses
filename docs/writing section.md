     - explains the importance of outlining before starting
     - Outline as the backbone of your thesis
     - provides tips for breaking down your thesis into sections

     - guides on using short, direct sentences and avoiding unnecessary jargon
     - advises defining technical terms for readers unfamiliar with the topic
   - **Rule 4: Revise Extensively**
     - recommends a multi-step revision process, focusing on structure first, then content, and finally grammar
     - encourages seeking feedback from your supervisor
   - **Rule 5: Use Illustrations Wisely**
     - discusses the purpose of visuals and when to include them (e.g., data-heavy sections, complex processes)
     - warns against overloading the thesis with unnecessary graphics


3. **Structuring Your Thesis**
   - **Section Naming Guide**:
     - *Introduction*: introduces the research problem, objectives, and relevance
     - *Literature Review*/ *Theoretical Background*: summarizes previous research and identifies gaps
     - *Methods*: details the research methodology used
     - *Results*: presents findings clearly and concisely
     - *Discussion*: interprets the results and their implications
     - *Conclusion*: summarizes contributions and suggests areas for further research
   - **Checklist for Key Components**:
     - Research objectives and hypotheses
     - Key literature with citations
     - Research design and methodology
     - Expected outcomes or contributions to the field

4. **Creating an Outline**:
   - creating a general outline for any chapter in a thesis involves structuring the content systematically to ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with the paper's objectives
   - not really a universal approach due to the different contents of the chapter
   - *links to the "Structuring Your Thesis" section for guidance on creating detailed outlines*

     - importance of using topic sentences to maintain focus in each paragraph
     - suggestions for integrating references into the text without disrupting flow
   - **Recommended Writing Sequence**
     1. **Methods Section**:
        - easiest section to write first since it’s factual and descriptive
        - sets a foundation for presenting results
     2. **Results Section**:
        - focus on presenting data without interpretation
        - utilize tables, charts, or summarized text as needed
     3. **Discussion Section**:
        - analyzes results in the context of research objectives and questions
        - identifies limitations and discusses implications
     4. **Introduction and Literature Review**:
        - write these later to ensure alignment with what the study achieved
        - contextualize findings and highlight research significance
     5. **Conclusion**:
        - recap key insights and their relevance
        - avoid introducing new ideas or findings

2. **When Are Illustrations Needed?**
   - **Data Presentation**:
     - use charts, graphs, or tables for numerical data
   - **Clarifying Processes**:
     - include flowcharts or diagrams to explain methodologies or workflows
   - **Enhancing Understanding**:
     - use concept maps for theoretical frameworks
   - **Illustration Best Practices**:
     - ensure all visuals are clear, professionally designed, and properly labeled
     - avoid printing large code or class diagrams; focus on architecture and key mechanisms

## Page three: **Finishing Phase**

**Polishing Your Work for Submission**

1. **Revising Extensively**
   - **Step-by-Step Revision Process**:
     - start with structure: Ensure sections flow logically
     - revise content: Improve clarity, coherence, and depth of information
     - finalize language: Check grammar, spelling, and style consistency
   - **Seeking Feedback**:
     - collaborate with peers or supervisors to identify improvement areas

2. **Finalizing Illustrations**
   - **Visual Alignment**:
     - verify that all visuals complement the text and are necessary
     - check for consistency in design style and labeling
   - **Avoid Redundancy**:
     - do not repeat information from visuals in the text unnecessarily
   - **Special Visuals**:
     - use diagrams for system architectures or pseudo-code instead of full code listings

3. **Language Guidelines**
   - **When to Use Present Tense**:
     - general truths or accepted knowledge
     - descriptions of the paper’s content and findings (e.g., “Figure 1 shows…”)
   - **When to Use Past Tense**:
     - descriptions of specific methods, experiments, or results
     - discussion of prior research

4. **Citation Guidelines**
   - **When should you cite directly?**
   - **When should you cite indirectly?**
   - **How does the APA format look?**
