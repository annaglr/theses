## Setup

- Repository and template (based on the proposal)
- Backups
- Grammarly license
- Reference manager
- Schedule and work plan
- Criteria

- The [evaluation criteria](docs/evaluation.html)
- The thesis template for [Markdown](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/thesis-template){: target="_blank"} ([create repository from template](https://github.com/new?template_name=thesis-template&template_owner=digital-work-lab){: target="_blank"}) <!-- or [word](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/main/assets/docs/template.docx) -->
- The [literature review section](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/20_processes/20.10.literature-review.html){: target="_blank"}
- The [analysis templates section](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/20_processes/20.21.analysis-templates.html){: target="_blank"}
- The [Bamberg Center for Empirical Studies (BACES)](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/baces/){: target="_blank"} offers free consultation related to data management and statistical analyses
- The [writing section](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/20-research/20_processes/20.29.writing.html) (in particular correct citation practices)
- The [guideline for the use of digital tools](docs/digital_tools.html)
- Note: ethics statements cannot be issued for a thesis, but students are advised to consult the [ethics](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/gremien/senat-kommissionen/kommissionen/ethikrat/){: target="_blank"} page.

It is good practice to write the thesis in a Git-versioned repository, add notes from the meetings to the README.md file, and give your thesis advisor access to the repository.

Remember to create **regular backups** of your work, e.g., by creating Git versions and pushing them to a remote repository, and/or copying files to a USB stick.

## Structuring Your Thesis

**Importance of Structure**: explains why structuring your thesis early on can save time and improve readability

  - **Section Naming Guide**:
    - *Introduction*: introduces the research problem, objectives, and relevance
    - *Literature Review*/ *Theoretical Background*: summarizes previous research and identifies gaps
    - *Methods*: details the research methodology used
    - *Results*: presents findings clearly and concisely
    - *Discussion*: interprets the results and their implications
    - *Conclusion*: summarizes contributions and suggests areas for further research

  - **Checklist for Key Components**:
    - Research objectives and hypotheses
    - Key literature with citations
    - Research design and methodology
    - Expected outcomes or contributions to the field

## Creating an Outline

   - creating a general outline for any chapter in a thesis involves structuring the content systematically to ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with the paper's objectives
   - not really a universal approach due to the different contents of the chapter
