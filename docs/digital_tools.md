# Guideline for the Use of Digital Tools

The integration of digital tools, including Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, grammar checkers, and reference managers, is increasingly common in academic research and writing.
To uphold intellectual honesty and academic ethics, students should transparently acknowledge the use of these tools in their theses.

To acknowledge the use of digital tools, include a section titled **Digital Tools Used** after the conclusion of your thesis.

Usage and Acknowledgement

**1. Transparent Disclosure**
 - Mention all digital tools utilized, such as grammar checkers, and LLMs like ChatGPT. Specify the type of assistance each tool provides.
 - For LLMs/ChatGPT, detail the specific nature of their assistance (e.g., idea generation, language suggestions).
 - If you write a standalone review, you can mention the use of particular reference managers or Excel in the methods section.
 - You do not have to acknowledge basic tools like Microsoft Word.
 - It is not necessary to acknowledge the use of basic spell-checkers (in Word, or Grammarly/DeepL).

**2. Validation of Information**
 - Cross-verify any information or data provided by digital tools with credible academic sources.
 - The responsibility for factual accuracy and data integrity remains with the thesis author(s), despite the use of these tools.

**3. Distinguishing Intellectual Contribution**
 - Clearly differentiate between your original contributions and those supplemented by digital tools.
 - Use digital tools as aids to enhance your work, not as replacements for your intellectual effort.

**4. Adherence to Ethical Standards**
 - Comply with your institutionâ€™s policies regarding the use of digital tools in academic research.
 - Ensure your usage of these tools does not infringe upon academic integrity principles.

**5. Citing Digital Tools**
 - When appropriate, cite the use of digital tools. For instance, reference LLMs/ChatGPT as: "Assisted by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI (year)."
 - Include similar citations for other digital tools as needed.

**6. Responsibility for Final Content**
 - Acknowledge that you, as the author, bear full responsibility for the content of your thesis.
 - Ensure the use of digital tools does not compromise the originality and academic rigor of your work.

It is essential to use digital tools, including LLMs like ChatGPT, thoughtfully and ethically in academic writing.
By adhering to these guidelines, students can leverage these tools effectively while maintaining the credibility and integrity required in academic scholarship.
